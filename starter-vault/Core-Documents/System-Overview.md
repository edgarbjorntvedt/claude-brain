# System Overview

## 🧠 What is the Brain System?

The Brain System is a comprehensive knowledge management and AI assistance framework that extends Claude's capabilities with:
- Persistent memory storage
- Code execution abilities
- Note-taking integration
- Tool orchestration
- Project management

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Brain Server** (`claude-brain`)
   - SQLite database for memories
   - Python/Shell code execution
   - Obsidian vault integration
   - State management system

2. **MCP Tools Ecosystem**
   - 30+ specialized tools
   - Each tool serves a specific purpose
   - Tools can work together

3. **Obsidian Integration**
   - Your notes become searchable memory
   - Bidirectional sync with Brain
   - Knowledge graph visualization

### Data Types

1. **Memories** (Persistent)
   - Key-value storage
   - Survives between sessions
   - Searchable content
   - Types: project, pattern, general

2. **State** (Categorized)
   - System: Core configuration
   - Project: Project-specific data
   - Session: Current session data
   - Cache: Temporary storage
   - Config: User settings

3. **Notes** (Documents)
   - Markdown files in Obsidian
   - Full-text searchable
   - Linked knowledge

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. Persistent Memory
```
brain_remember { "key": "important_fact", "value": "data" }
brain_recall { "query": "important" }
```

### 2. Code Execution
```
brain_execute {
  "code": "print('Hello, Brain!')",
  "language": "python"
}
```

### 3. Note Management
```
obsidian_note {
  "action": "create",
  "title": "New Idea",
  "content": "## My brilliant idea..."
}
```

### 4. Unified Search
```
unified_search {
  "query": "machine learning",
  "source": "all"
}
```

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

1. **Initialize Session**: `brain_init`
2. **Check Context**: Review reminders and status
3. **Work on Projects**: Use tools and store progress
4. **Document Insights**: Create notes and memories
5. **End Session**: Save important state

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Memory Management
- Use descriptive keys
- Organize with types
- Regular cleanup of old data
- Document important decisions

### Project Organization
- One project = one namespace
- Regular status updates
- Clear documentation
- Use state for temporary data

### Note Taking
- Link related notes
- Use consistent naming
- Add metadata
- Regular reviews

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### 1. Output Filtering
- Prevents context window flooding
- Smart truncation with metadata
- Verbose mode for full output

### 2. Tool Orchestration
- Tools can call each other
- Workflow automation
- Complex task chains

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- Learn from usage patterns
- Suggest relevant tools
- Adaptive assistance

## 📚 Learning Path

1. **Beginner**: Focus on basic memory and notes
2. **Intermediate**: Explore state management and projects
3. **Advanced**: Build custom workflows and automations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Service not running**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Memory errors**: Check database permissions
- **Search not working**: Rebuild search index
- **Tools not found**: Verify configuration
